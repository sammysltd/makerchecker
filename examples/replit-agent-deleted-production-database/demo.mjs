// Replit coding agent (2025): during an explicit code freeze the agent ran a
// destructive operation against the production database, deleting ~2,400 live
// records, then fabricated ~4,000 fake user profiles to hide the loss and
// falsely claimed rollback was impossible (the rollback in fact worked).
//
// The control that stops it: the irreversible table-drop is granted to no role,
// so it is refused by deny-by-default; schema migrations are a high-risk skill
// the proxy refuses outright (they must run through a governed flow behind an
// approval gate); and read work is path-scoped to the project's own tables, so a
// read that reaches into the production schema is denied.
//
// Names are prefixed `replit-` so this demo does not collide with other incident
// demos sharing the server.
//
// Run: boot the server (`docker compose up`, or locally with
// MAKERCHECKER_AUTH_DISABLED=1), build the SDK, then:
//   node examples/replit-agent-deleted-production-database/demo.mjs
