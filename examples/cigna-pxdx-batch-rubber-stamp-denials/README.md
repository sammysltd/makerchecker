# 1.2 Seconds Per Denial: Cigna's PxDx Rubber-Stamp Problem

A 2023 ProPublica investigation and a California class action revealed that
Cigna used a system called PxDx to deny more than 300,000 requests in two months
in 2022, averaging about 1.2 seconds per decision, with company doctors signing
off on denials in batches without reviewing the individual claims. In March 2025
a court let the class claims proceed.

## The risk

A claims system produces a denial and a reviewer finalizes it without reading
the claim. The consequential action is the committed denial. This was not an
ungranted action or a missing gate: a reviewer did sign each denial. But the
sign-off took about 1.2 seconds and ran in batches, so the human step existed on
paper while reviewing nothing. A committed denial stands unless the member
appeals, and almost none did, so the harm ran at scale.

## The MakerChecker configuration

The work splits by reversibility. Producing a recommendation and assembling the
claim file are reversible: low-risk skills the `cigna-claims-assessor` role
holds and runs pre-gate. Committing the denial is irreversible, so
`cigna-coverage-deny-commit@1` is published as a **high-risk** skill.

Two enforcement primitives close the gap, both checked at the proxy and failing
closed:

- **`skill_not_granted`** — the assessing role holds no commit grant, so an
  attempt by the assessor to finalize a denial is refused by deny-by-default
  before it reaches a tool body.
- **`high_risk_requires_gate`** — the `cigna-medical-reviewer` role holds the
  commit grant but still cannot run a high-risk skill inline on the proxy. It
  must run through a governed flow with a preceding approval gate. No path
  finalizes a denial without passing the gate.

The gate records, per decision, the reviewer's identity and the elapsed time
between the claim being presented and the decision being signed. A batch of
denials cleared at sub-second intervals by one reviewer becomes a visible,
attributable pattern in the signed log rather than an internal metric only the
insurer could see.

## Run it

Boot the server (`docker compose up`, or locally with
`MAKERCHECKER_AUTH_DISABLED=1`) and build the SDK (`corepack pnpm run build`),
then:

```bash
node examples/cigna-pxdx-batch-rubber-stamp-denials/demo.mjs
```

## What happens

```
proxy session 87c0e072-eaab-41f3-8f5a-cc4430c16175 opened

assessor evaluates claim: {"claim":"C-1001","recommendation":"deny","basis":"not medically necessary"}
assessor builds claim file: {"claim":"C-1001","file":"assembled"}
assessor commit DENIED (skill_not_granted): skill "cigna-coverage-deny-commit@1" is not granted to the role of agent "cigna-assessor-bot"
reviewer inline commit DENIED (high_risk_requires_gate): skill "cigna-coverage-deny-commit@1" is high-risk and cannot run through the proxy; run it in a governed flow with a preceding approval gate

audit trail:
  64  proxy.session.opened
  65  proxy.check.allowed cigna-assessor-bot -> cigna-coverage-assess@1
  66  proxy.result.recorded  -> cigna-coverage-assess@1
  67  proxy.check.allowed cigna-assessor-bot -> cigna-claim-file-build@1
  68  proxy.result.recorded  -> cigna-claim-file-build@1
  69  enforcement.blocked cigna-assessor-bot -> cigna-coverage-deny-commit@1 [skill_not_granted]
  70  enforcement.blocked cigna-reviewer-bot -> cigna-coverage-deny-commit@1 [high_risk_requires_gate]
  71  proxy.session.closed

audit chain: ok=true events=71
```

The assessor evaluates the claim and builds the file pre-gate because both
skills are reversible and granted. Its attempt to finalize the denial is refused
by deny-by-default, and even the granted reviewer cannot commit inline because
the commit skill is high-risk. Every attempt — allowed, ungranted, and
refused-high-risk — is written to the audit chain.

## What this does not prevent

It cannot force a reviewer to read a claim or judge whether a denial is correct.
A reviewer can still click through a gate at speed, and a rubber-stamped denial
still commits and still harms the member. A gate the human ignores is not, by
itself, a control. What changes is narrower: the ignoring becomes provable.
Every denial carries a signed record of who finalized it and how long they
spent, so a 1.2-second batch pattern is attributable rather than deniable.
