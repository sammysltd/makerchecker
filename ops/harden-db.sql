-- MakerChecker DB least-privilege hardening (Layer 2 in SECURITY.md / 0001_init.sql).
--
-- WHAT THIS CLOSES
--   The append-only audit_events triggers and the immutable instance-row guard
--   bind at the TABLE level, but a PostgreSQL table OWNER can DISABLE its own
--   triggers (ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE TRIGGER) and then UPDATE/DELETE freely.
--   The single-role docker/quickstart default connects as the owner, so a
--   compromised application credential could silently rewrite the audit log.
--   This script provisions a separate runtime role that does NOT own any table
--   and is REVOKEd UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE on the tamper-evident tables, so it
--   can APPEND audit rows but can never mutate, delete, truncate, or disable the
--   guards on them. This is the non-owner runtime role referenced in SECURITY.md.
--
-- HOW TO USE (two-role pattern)
--   1. The OWNER role (the role that created the database and ran the migrations)
--      applies this script ONCE, after migrations:
--
--        psql "$DATABASE_URL_OWNER" -v mc_runtime_password='<strong-password>' \
--          -f ops/harden-db.sql
--
--      Re-running it is safe: every statement below is idempotent.
--   2. Point the server's DATABASE_URL at mc_app_runtime (NOT the owner). See
--      docker-compose.hardened.yml for the compose form.
--
--   This script does NOT run as part of the normal migrations on purpose:
--   CREATE ROLE needs elevated privileges that ephemeral CI/test databases (which
--   run as a single owner/superuser and intentionally DISABLE triggers in
--   adversarial tests) do not grant. The default single-role flow stays untouched.
--
-- IDEMPOTENCY / SAFETY
--   Run as the table owner (or a superuser). The runtime password is read from
--   the psql variable :mc_runtime_password and defaults to 'mc_app_runtime' only
--   so the script never fails when invoked without it; ALWAYS pass a real
--   password in any deployment you care about, or set it out of band with
--   ALTER ROLE mc_app_runtime PASSWORD '...'.

\set ON_ERROR_STOP on

-- Default the password variable when the caller did not pass one. psql has no
-- "default if unset", so test it with a sentinel and override only when missing.
\if :{?mc_runtime_password}
\else
  \set mc_runtime_password 'mc_app_runtime'
\endif

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. Runtime role. CREATE ROLE is not idempotent, so emit it only when the role
--    is absent (\gexec runs the row this SELECT returns, none if it exists).
--    LOGIN so the server can connect; NOSUPERUSER/NOCREATEDB/NOCREATEROLE so a
--    compromised credential cannot escalate. The password is set in the same
--    CREATE because the value is interpolated by psql here; psql does NOT
--    substitute :variables inside a dollar-quoted DO block, so this stays at the
--    top level.
--
--    Re-runs do NOT reset the password: ALTER ROLE ... PASSWORD requires
--    superuser or ADMIN on the role, which a plain table-owner running this
--    script may not hold (roles are cluster-global, so the role can pre-exist).
--    To rotate the password later, run as superuser (or a role with ADMIN on
--    mc_app_runtime): ALTER ROLE mc_app_runtime PASSWORD '<new>'.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT format(
  'CREATE ROLE mc_app_runtime LOGIN NOSUPERUSER NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE '

\gexec

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. Connect + schema usage. The role needs to reach the database and resolve
--    objects in the public schema, but no DDL rights there (it must not be able
--    to CREATE shadow tables or functions). current_database() keeps the script
--    portable across database names.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DO $$
BEGIN
  EXECUTE format('GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE %I TO mc_app_runtime', current_database());

GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO mc_app_runtime;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 3. Baseline DML on every existing application table. The server reads and
--    writes mutable run-state (flow_runs, step_runs, approvals, ...) and appends
--    to the governed/append-only tables. We grant the full SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/
--    DELETE set broadly here, then REVOKE the dangerous verbs back from the
--    tamper-evident tables in step 4. Sequences backing identity/serial columns
--    need USAGE so INSERTs can draw default values.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO mc_app_runtime;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO mc_app_runtime;

-- migrate() at boot does CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_migrations and
-- SELECT/INSERT against it. When migrations are already applied by the owner the
-- CREATE is a no-op, but the runtime role still reads the table; ensure access.
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF to_regclass('public.schema_migrations') IS NOT NULL THEN
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON schema_migrations TO mc_app_runtime;
  END IF;
END
$$;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 4. Lock down the tamper-evident tables. audit_events is append-only and
--    instance is write-once: the runtime role keeps SELECT + INSERT (append a
--    new audit row; instance row is seeded by the owner migration) but loses
--    UPDATE, DELETE, and TRUNCATE. Without UPDATE/DELETE the role cannot rewrite
--    history even if a logic sink is found; not owning the tables, it also cannot
--    ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE TRIGGER to defeat the append-only guards. TRUNCATE
--    is owner-only by default in Postgres, but REVOKE it explicitly so intent is
--    documented and a future broad GRANT cannot silently re-enable it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE ON audit_events FROM mc_app_runtime;
REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE ON instance     FROM mc_app_runtime;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 5. One-time first-boot key publication. ensureInstanceKeys publishes the
--    instance Ed25519 public key exactly once (instance.public_key_pem: NULL ->
--    value) on the first key-bearing operation. The instance_immutable trigger
--    already makes that the ONLY permitted UPDATE (write-once, no rotation), so a
--    column-scoped UPDATE(public_key_pem) is safe to grant: the role can fill the
--    key once and nothing more. After publication, steady state needs only
--    SELECT. Pre-seeding instance.public_key_pem as the owner and skipping this
--    grant is an equally valid, tighter option (see SECURITY.md).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GRANT UPDATE (public_key_pem) ON instance TO mc_app_runtime;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 6. Future tables inherit the baseline. ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES is keyed to
--    the role that CREATES the future object (FOR ROLE ...), not to whoever runs
--    this script. Migrations are applied by the table owner, which may differ
--    from the (possibly superuser) role bootstrapping this hardening. So set the
--    defaults FOR each role that owns an existing application table -- i.e. the
--    migration owner(s). New migrations then get SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE and
--    sequence access automatically. If a future migration adds another
--    tamper-evident table, REVOKE the mutating verbs from it the same way as
--    step 4 (defaults intentionally do not guess which tables are append-only).
