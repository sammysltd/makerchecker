 * Seeds the demo content: the admin user, then four demo casts — Daily Cash
 * Reconciliation (the happy-path recon flow, the self-approval flow that SoD
 * blocks, and the n-of-m high-value-payment flow), AML Alert Triage (an
 * analyst agent, a four-eye SoD constraint against the officer role, and a
 * flow that parks at a BSA-officer gate), MDR Reportability Triage (medical
 * devices: complaints in, regulatory-officer gate on reportability), PV
 * ICSR Processing (medicines: adverse-event cases in, medical-review gate),
 * Gross-to-Net Margin (pharma/medtech commercial: ERP pricing in,
 * finance-controller certification gate before any figure enters the
 * financials), and Cold-Chain Disposition (a temperature excursion in transit:
 * the monitor agent assesses stability and QUARANTINES affected lots ITSELF —
 * holding is the safe direction, allowed and recorded but ungated — while the
 * one-way release-or-destroy decision is gated to a named QA person; a
 * high-risk disposition skill structurally forces that gate), and GMP
 * Environmental-Monitoring Excursion Disposition (the same asymmetry re-skinned
 * from a temperature excursion to a microbial/CFU cleanroom excursion: the
 * monitor agent quarantines the affected batch itself, while the one-way
 * release-or-reject decision is gated to the independent quality unit, enforcing
 * 21 CFR 211.22 — a named signature AND executor != approver). Idempotent: each
 * cast is guarded by its flagship flow name, so seeding is safe on every boot —
 * including boots of databases seeded before a cast existed.
