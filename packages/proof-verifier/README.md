# @makerchecker/proof-verifier

A standalone, **zero-dependency, zero-trust** verifier for MakerChecker audit
bundles. It re-implements verification from the public
[audit specification](../../docs/audit-spec.md) alone — it does **not** import
the server, touch a database, or make a network call. Hand it a signed bundle
and it tells you, offline, whether the chain is intact and who signed it.

> An auditor trusts this verifier *because* it is not the vendor's server. The
> code is Apache-2.0 and reproducible; the trust is in the independence.

## Why it exists

A MakerChecker deployment exports a signed, hash-chained record of every agent
action (`audit export`). The value of that record is that **anyone can check it
without trusting us**. This package is the reference independent checker: a CLI,
an importable isomorphic core, and a single-file web page that runs entirely in
the browser with nothing uploaded.

## CLI

```bash
npx @makerchecker/proof-verifier verify bundle.json
# pin the instance public key (obtained out of band) so a re-signed bundle is rejected:
npx @makerchecker/proof-verifier verify bundle.json --key instance-pubkey.pem
# pipe it, or get machine-readable output:
cat bundle.json | agent-proof verify - --json
```

Exit code `0` = verified, `1` = failed, `2` = usage error.

```
PASS  8 events, full chain (genesis-rooted)
      head 4c5e1a8a2c226d3…b68e02d4474d46c
      key  sha256:bb48c332…7fc889d   (public-key fingerprint, abbreviated)
```

## Browser

Open [`verifier.html`](./verifier.html) in a recent browser, or save it and open
it offline. Drop a bundle in; all hashing and Ed25519 verification happen
locally via WebCrypto. This is the file you can hand a regulator: it keeps
working with no server, no account, and no internet, even after a contract ends.

## Library

```js
import { verifyBundle, nodeCrypto } from "@makerchecker/proof-verifier";

const result = await verifyBundle(bundle, nodeCrypto, {
  expectedPublicKeyPem, // optional out-of-band key pinning
});
// { ok: true, count, bundleKind, headHash, keyFingerprint }
// | { ok: false, reason, reasonCode?, failedSeq?, path? }
```

The core (`@makerchecker/proof-verifier/core`) is isomorphic: all cryptography
is injected through a provider, so the same logic runs under Node and in the
browser.

## What it checks

Per the [audit spec](../../docs/audit-spec.md):

1. **Signature** — Ed25519 over the RFC 8785 canonical signing string.
2. **Count** — events match the signed count.
3. **Hash-set digest** — the exact event set and order are bound into the signature.
4. **Per-event hashes** — every event's SHA-256 recomputes (any altered field fails here).
5. **Linkage** — full bundles verify complete genesis-rooted `prev_hash` linkage;
   run bundles verify every event is bound to the signed `run_id`.
6. **Head & bounds** — head hash and first/last seq match the manifest.
7. **Key pinning (optional)** — rejects a bundle re-signed with any key but the pinned one.

### Spec-violation verdicts (distinct from tamper)

The spec requires hashed input to be **I-JSON (RFC 7493)**: every string —
object key or value — must be well-formed Unicode. RFC 8785 presumes I-JSON
and defines no interoperable byte sequence for an unpaired surrogate
(implementations disagree: ES2019 `JSON.stringify` emits a `\ud800` escape,
Python/Go RFC 8785 libraries throw or emit different bytes), so a hash over
such a string can never cross-verify. When a bundle contains one, the verifier
returns a **machine-readable spec-violation reject**, deliberately distinct
from a tamper verdict:

```js
{
  ok: false,
  reasonCode: "ill_formed_string", // machine-readable verdict class
  failedSeq: "9",                  // the offending event (absent for a manifest string)
  path: "$.payload.note",          // JSON path of the ill-formed string
  reason: "event seq 9 contains an ill-formed string (unpaired surrogate) at $.payload.note: ..."
}
```

`ill_formed_string` proves nothing was altered — it says the bundle violates
the spec's I-JSON requirement, its hashes were never well-defined, and it must
not be accepted. Producers running the fixed pipeline can no longer emit such
bundles (ill-formed strings are rejected at API ingress with HTTP 400 and by
the serializer itself, fail closed). No Unicode normalization is ever applied:
NFC and NFD strings are distinct bytes, and characters outside JSON's
mandatory escape set (including astral characters like U+1F600) are hashed and
emitted literally — the `unicode-literal` vector proves both properties.

## Conformance vectors

[`vectors/`](./vectors) is a public corpus: valid full and run bundles (one
with astral + NFC/NFD strings proving literal, unnormalized Unicode handling)
plus adversarial variants (tampered payload, corrupted signature, truncation,
reordering, a re-signed foreign-run splice, a wrong-key forgery, and an
ill-formed-string bundle that must be rejected as an I-JSON spec violation),
each with the verdict a conformant verifier must return in
[`vectors/index.json`](./vectors/index.json). Any implementation in any language
can run these and self-certify.

The corpus is **deterministic and frozen**: external implementers can pin the
committed vector files by hash. Regeneration is byte-reproducible — every
timestamp and id is a fixed constant, event UUIDs are derived from SHA-256 of
a fixed namespace string, and the bundles are signed with the committed
[`vectors/test-fixture-signing-key.pem`](./vectors/test-fixture-signing-key.pem),
a **deliberately public** test fixture (never a secret, never used outside this
corpus; see the header of
[`scripts/build-vectors.mjs`](./scripts/build-vectors.mjs)). `npm test`
regenerates into a temp directory and fails on any byte diff against the
committed files, so the corpus cannot drift silently.

```bash
npm test            # byte-compares a fresh regeneration, then asserts every verdict
npm run build:vectors   # regenerate in place (must be a no-op diff)
```

The reimplementation here is cross-checked to be **byte-identical** to the
producer's own primitives (`@makerchecker/shared`), so "verify from the spec
alone" is a fact, not a slogan.
